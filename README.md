# Prompt flow Multi-round Chat on Your Data Lab
Prompt flow is a development tool designed to streamline the entire development cycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Prompt flow provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies the process of prototyping, experimenting, iterating, and deploying your AI applications.

This lab walks you through the process of creating a RAG flow in Prompt flow.

## Pre requisites
1. An AI Search instance with indexed data that you want to RAG over.
2. Access to Azure AI Studio.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. In AI Studio, create a new flow. Select the `Upload` button in the Upload from local tile on the dialog that opens.
3. Select the .zip file from this repository. This will import the initial flow.
